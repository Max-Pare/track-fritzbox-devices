# track-fritzbox-devices
Requires telegram-send package and fritconnection package (pip install-able).
telegram-send needs to be configured: https://pypi.org/project/telegram-send/

Some fritzbox router won't require a password if you're connecting directly to it through LAN,
but in case you get an error you need to change the password="PASSWORD" field.
